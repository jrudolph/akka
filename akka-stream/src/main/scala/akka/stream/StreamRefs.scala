 *
 * See also [[akka.stream.scaladsl.SinkRef]] which is the dual of a SourceRef.
 *
 * To create a SourceRef you have to materialize the Source that you want to get the reference to,
 * and run it `to` the `SourceRef.sink`. A such obtained `SourceRef` can be then shared with a remote host.
 * Once materialized, it will start pulling data from the source you originally materialized to obtain the source reference.
 *
 * For additional configuration see `reference.conf` as well as [[akka.stream.StreamRefAttributes]].
